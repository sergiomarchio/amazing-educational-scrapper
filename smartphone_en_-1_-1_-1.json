Typically the battery should last 5 years or longer. Unfortunately, this battery is non removable/non replaceable. Here's a few suggestions if you suspect it is the battery. (1) Try another charger. A non-removable battery phone not charging could be a result of damage or an incompatible charger. (2) Try charging it overnight if you haven't already. (3) Inspect the charging port. Sometimes it may contain moisture or lint. You can try cleaning it by blowing dry air into the port or using a tiny object to remove the dirt. The blow dryer at a hotter setting will also help to remove and dry any trapped moisture inside the charging port. Afterwards let it dry overnight.(4)Once that's completed, try doing a forced restart of the phone. -- Plug in your phone with the charger.-- Press and hold the power button for at least 10-15 seconds.

That is very important to point out. Until Verizon completes their rollout of HD Voice (VoLTE) to all of their Visible customers which has been lagging behind as compared to their rollout to their main Verizon customers, Today anyone who uses the Visible IMEI phone tool to check a Motorola device for compatibility is going to receive an incompatible response. The fact is that Verizon is discontinuing 3G and only universally supporting 4G in CDMA without VoLTE until 12/31/22. The rollout of VoLTE including 5G for Visible customers is currently behind schedule. Consequently this means that Verizon is erroring on the safe side in TEMPORARILY declining new customers to Visible as they want to be assured that both voice and data support will work successfully across all zip codes in their network. On the other hand, If you use the compatibility tool at the main Verizon website the response will show compatible when connected to VoLTE. Even in the past when Visible issued service on 4G Motorola phones they used to include a disclosure that read \"all features of a phone may not be available with their service.\" In conclusion. If you've already purchased this phone you can still request a SIM card from Visible and your phone may still work. Their higher priced parent company Verizon still remains a valid option to also consider immediately. I realize how confusing this may sound but seriously I'm just being honest with you.

That is very important to point out.  What this means is that until Verizon has successfully completed their installation of their 5G network this phone would have to rely on 4G LTE VolTE and 3G connectivity to successfully work in both voice and data across their network system.  The fact is that Verizon is discontinuing 3G and only universally supporting 4G in CDMA without VoLTE through their sub brand Visible of which this phone the Motorola One 5G Ace (unlocked) doesn't offer.  Consequently this means that unless Verizon can with (100% assurance) know that their 4G LTE with VoLTE which they are also converting over to is available in your service area, they will state for (future Visible customers exclusively) that any Motorola device is not compatible when you use  Visible's IMEI tool which is separate from the tool offered at Verizon .  Even in the past when Visible issued service on 4G or 5G Motorola phones  they used to include a disclosure that read \"all features of a phone may not be available with their service.\" In conclusion.iIf you've already purchased this phone you can still request a SIM card  from Visible and your phone may still work.  Their higher priced parent company Verizon still remains a valid option to also consider. However, right now with Verizon and AT&T both being the 2 major carriers in- flux undergoing network conversions,  I would lean towards  T-Mobile or one of their lower cost MVNO's as a viable alternative to Visible Wireless. At least wait until Verizon has fully completed their transition to VoLTE and fully installed their 5G towers nationwide.  I realize how confusing this may sound but seriously I'm just being honest with you.\n        \n          see less", "badge_text": "", "is_manufacturer": false, "is_seller": false, "date": "2022/07/26", "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}, {"id": "answer-Mx36PMP92PA9IQ7", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx31AG8XTFV868O/ref=ask_ql_ql_al_hza", "answer": "Thank you for your inquiry.

You can also choose to open it via double tapping the screen.  You can also shake the phone and it opens the flashlight.  Also, you can double push the volume down button to open the camera.

Unfortunately, Visible services have not yet fully caught up with Verizon in all their service areas.

This is why the IMEI tool at Visible may say not compatible choosing to error instead on the safe side until all these bugs are worked out. However, the Verizon IMEI tool itself will say differently and confirm compatibility Frustrating I know. Keep in mind most of Verizon's customers on their main service are using locked phones . Visible was their affordably priced gateway to supporting unlocked devices to attract new customers. The good news is that Verizon hopes to have this all ironed out hopefully by 1/1/2023.

There is a cheat however that will turn the camera from crap to pretty decent. Go to the play store and download GCamantor. After you install it. It is going to say you have to enable your Camer2api (or say nothing and just seems to be looking for it)... It is going to seem like it will not work.  Instead click on the data base and it will list a bunch of Xiaomi devices. Chose the Redmi 8 Note Pro (if it is in there twice choose the second one). You will know right away if it took or not with the next step. After you install the 8 note pro it will ask for permission to access the camera. If it did not take you will be right back to where you started. It will seem like you did nothing. This is how I know to pick the 2nd one if it appears on the list twice. Once installed you never have to go into GCamantor again. You will now have 2 camera icons on your device. One will be the stock camera settings (which will work) and the other will be like GCam (which will work also) and it is amazing!!!! You will now have night mode and all the other goodies that come with GCam. The rear camera by default will be 12MB when you switch it to 48MB it will seems to lag a bit and you will not be sure if you need to hold the camera on the target area until it is done processing. You don't, just take the picture and give it a second to process the picture (you will see a circle status bar) it is pretty quick. Maybe a second tops..... But WOW what a difference. It will now rival some flagship phones (yes even Samsung). Keep in mind that it will only work on the single rear camera. The other lenses will not be affected (the reason why it tells you to enable the camera2api, even tho you cant). So if you want to capture the hairs on a bees leg, you are kinda out of luck. You are stuck with the stock software. But all your normal picture taking, in any light conditions will be mind blowing!!! And it is free so what is not to like. Again if you don't, you will have sub par pictures that might rival another Made in China $100 phone.\n        \n          see less", "badge_text": "", "is_manufacturer": false, "is_seller": false, "date": "2021/07/05", "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}, {"id": "answer-Mx1VWF8PZ5AKR21", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx2JCBYK0ZNOAAM/ref=ask_ql_ql_al_hza", "answer": "Very good.

The phone needs to be GSM-compatible;\rTello Compatible BYOP devices include:\r\u2013 Most unlocked, GSM-network phones\r\u2013 Most unlocked T-Mobile, AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Simple Mobile, and Straight Talk phones\r2. The Phone needs to have the following capabilities;\r- 4G LTE compatible\rand\r- VoLTE friendly with our network\r- For minimum service, your phone would need at least the following 3 bands/frequencies.\r* Band 2 (1900 MHz)\r* Band 4 (1700/2100 MHz)\r* Band 12 (700 MHz)\rHowever, for best service on our GSM network, your phone should have at least 1 of the following bands/frequencies in addition to the above 3.\r* Band 5 (850 MHz)\r* Band 66 (1700 Mhz)\r* Band 71 (600 MHz)\rFor example, if the phone has bands 2, 4, 12, and 71, then that is ideal.\rThe older your phone, the less likely it supports 4G LTE and VoLTE which is needed to work on Tello\u2019s network.\r3. The phone needs to be unlocked.\r- If your phone is locked by the phone's previous provider, it will need to be unlocked by them before it can be used with the Tello service.\r- Our online device checker can NOT check if a device is locked or not.\r4. Device must be made for the US market.\rOnly models manufactured for the US market will activate on our network. Message ends \rSo this was their response to me.  It appears that the phone meets all these requirements but the optional Band 71.  That band is used primarily on CDMA networks for rural areas which may be of concern to you.  My only other concern is whether this phone will meet T-Mobile's strict  MVNO security update requirements and VOLTE friendly status to be included on their approved list.   I need a phone right away as I've been notified via email by Tello my older phone will stop working soon.  I hope this helps and I think I may take the plunge and  buy the phone. I don't really care that its camera not even close  as good as Moto phones or the battery life is also shorter.  I like the fact that the vivid display on this TCL  unlike Moto rivals OLED phones out there costing a lot more.    I just wish it was also CDMA compatible  to give me more options in the future.\n        \n          see less", "badge_text": "", "is_manufacturer": false, "is_seller": false, "date": "2021/06/06", "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}, {"id": "answer-Mx1R0I8RR0FV96I", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx2V6GSTOF0B58M/ref=ask_ql_ql_al_hza", "answer": "New tellon system may or may not allow the TCL phone for its network.

So, theoretically, yes, if taking lots of photos in a row, the phone could slow down or freeze momentarily because the available RAM is full.
